	"description": "Too much stuff? Not enough pollution? Incinerate!\n\nThis mod adds a variant of the electric smelter that you can use to burn (almost) anything to ash. You can then compact each stack of ash to a tile of landfill using an assembling machine. But be careful - burning all that stuff emits lots of pollution.\n\nFeatures configurable settings in case you just want to quickly burn things into thin air, as quickly as your inserters will let you.\n\n9/10 Biters would recommend this mod to a friend."
