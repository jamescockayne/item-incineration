	"description": "Too much stuff? Not enough pollution? Incinerate!\n\nThis mod adds a variant of the electric smelter that you can use to burn (almost) anything to ash, which in turn can be compacted to landfill. But be careful - burning all that stuff emits lots of pollution.\n\nFeatures a host of configurable settings for quickly burning things into thin air, toggling pollution, and more!\n\nFact: 9/10 biters would recommend this mod to a friend."
